# Introduction

First off, I'd like to say Happy New Years!  To all of the readers here on our website!  Secondly Today marks the launch of our Support Center and a step forward into becoming a IT Service provider focused on Open Source Technology.

## Website Rebuild

We have completly rebuilt our website to conform to our intentions, making ourselves appear more as a business instead of as a simple portfolio.  The Website is built using Astro.build and based on the AstroShip theme, More details can be found in the [github repo](https://github.com/Adammatthiesen/mxyz-support)
